# IPDK Storage APIs

IPDK is switching to the OPI Storage APIs. As part of that work SMA will be
deprecated and will not be supported. This will be noted in the codebase and in
the 23.01 release notes. IPDK plans to complete the full transition to
OPI Storage APIs by 23.07 to allow for a full validation cycle.
