Actions:

- Request to consider a timeline for Networking APIs
  - While this is a good request from the TSC leads, it may be a difficult item to address given the multitude of network APIs that are available today and the market areas needs such as Cloud, Telco, K8s, etc.
  - The objective is to collect the various market views and work toward a converged set based on the contributions and various available API types.
